                        The carbon footprint is calculated by estimating the energy draw of the algorithm
                        and the carbon intensity of producing this energy at a given location:

                        `carbon footprint = energy needed * carbon intensity`

                        Where the energy needed is: 

                        `runtime * (cores power draw * usage + memory power draw) * PUE * multiplicative factor`

                        The power draw of the computing cores depends on the model and number of cores, 
                        while the memory power draw only depends on the size of memory _available_. 
                        The usage factor corrects for the real core usage (default is 1, i.e. full usage).
                        The PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) measures how much extra energy is needed 
                        to operate the data centre (cooling, lighting etc.). 
                        The multiplicative factor is used to take into account multiple identical runs 
                        (e.g. for testing or optimisation).

                        The Carbon Intensity depends on the location and the technologies used to produce electricity.
                        If you want to check out the carbon intensity in real time, and see discrepancies between countries,
                        check out the [ElectricityMap website](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map).

                        For instance, if choosing a reporting scope of 1 year and filling 
                        the form in continuous inference mode with an `input data time span` of 1 month,
                        then your environmental impacts correspond to the monthly results multiplied by 12.
                        
                        It is worth keeping in mind that __the reporting period only impacts the results
                        in the 'continuous inference' situation__.
